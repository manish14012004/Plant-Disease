#Plant Disease Detection 

Overview

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to identify and diagnose diseases in plants from images. The system can be used by farmers and agricultural experts to quickly detect plant diseases and suggest appropriate treatments, improving crop health and yield.

Features

Image-based plant disease detection
AI/ML model trained on a dataset of plant images
Real-time disease prediction
Provides detailed information about detected diseases
Suggestions for disease treatment and prevention

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (or any preferred framework)
Backend: Python, Flask/Django, FastAPI (or any backend framework)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch
Database: MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing plant disease information
Cloud Services: (Optional) AWS/GCP/Azure for deploying the app

Dataset

The model is trained on publicly available datasets containing labeled images of healthy and diseased plants. Some datasets that can be used:

PlantVillage Dataset

Other agriculture-specific datasets related to plant health and disease detection.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask/Django (depending on your backend framework)
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
React.js (optional, for frontend)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash

Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model (if not already trained) by running the script:

bash

Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the app:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Open the app in your browser:

bash

Copy code
http://localhost:5000
Usage
Upload an image of a plant leaf via the web interface.
The AI model will analyze the image and predict if the plant has any disease.
The result will display the type of disease (if detected) and suggested treatments.
